## ml-churn-prediction
End-to-end ML pipeline for customer churn prediction, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn using demographic, service, and billing data.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train classification models to predict churn
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Practice production-style ML project structure and Git workflows

## Dataset
The project uses a public customer churn dataset.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Dataset

This project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset from IBM.

**Source:** Kaggle – Telco Customer Churn

To run the notebooks:
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle
2. Place the CSV file in `data/raw/`
3. Ensure the file is named `telco_customer_churn.csv`
